Simple script generating dwarf frotress theme from pywal template.

Installation:
1. Place the ``colors-df'' file in ~/.config/wal/templates/
2. Run pywal
3. Change the $OUT variable in the ``pywal-df'' script to path to your Dwarf Fortress installation's ``colors.txt'' file (eg. OUT=~/df/data/init/colors.txt).

After the installation just run ``pywal-df'' file and open Dwarf Fortress.

Customization:
You can change the ``colors-df'' file to your liking. The syntax is pretty simple and easy to understand.
By default, the dark gray is set to the same color as light gray which makes the main menu usable.
